# Dashboard Visualization using Matplotlib and Tkinter

This project creates an interactive dashboard that visualizes sales, inventory, and product data using Matplotlib charts embedded in a Tkinter GUI. The dashboard provides five distinct visualizations to help analyze and monitor data trends.

## Features

1. **Bar Chart**: Displays sales data by product.
2. **Horizontal Bar Chart**: Shows inventory levels for each product.
3. **Pie Chart**: Represents the percentage breakdown of product categories.
4. **Line Chart**: Plots sales data over a series of years.
5. **Area Chart**: Illustrates inventory trends across months.

The GUI includes:
- A side navigation panel with a "Dashboard" label.
- A main area divided into two frames to display the charts.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for the project.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating the charts.
- **Tkinter**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
